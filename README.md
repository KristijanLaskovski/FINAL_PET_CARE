Our idea for this application was to create an app that will be used to help users who lost their pets, to help injured pets found on the streat, find the best tips for raising a pet and find the nearst pet store, hospital and rtc.

To use the application every user must register first, if he doesn't have an account by entering an username, name, lastname and a password. For connecting with the MySQL databese we used PHP scripts, and in the databese we stored inforamtion about users, posts made by them, then we hade also a table for storing comments on a post.

For navigating through the app we used the Android navigation drawer, wher tha main menu contained Home page, Profile,Tips for Pet care, Nearest pet stores and 3 submenu depending of the type of the post (posts for lost,Found, injured pets). <br/>

When an user founs a lost pet on the street, or his pet is injuered and needs help, or he wants to adopt a new pet hen he can make a comment by pressing the comment button in the botton-left corner.Then a new activity opens where he can enter informations about the location, type of the post, add a phone number so every one can contact him, add a photo and some text. When he finishes with adding the inforamtion he has to press on the post button.
