Our idea for this application was to create an app that will be used to help users who lost their pets, to help injured pets found on the streat, find the best tips for raising a pet and find the nearst pet store, hospital and rtc.

To use the application every user must register first, if he does't have an account by entering an username, name, lastname and a password. For connecting with the MySQL databese we used PHP scripts, and in the databese we stored inforamtion about users, posts made by them, then we hade also a table for storing comments on a post.
