 <h1>Pet Care App</h1>

Our idea for this application was to create an app that will be used to help users who lost their pets, to help injured pets found on the streat, find the best tips for raising a pet and find the nearst pet store, hospital and rtc.

For navigating through the app we used the Android navigation drawer, wher tha main menu contained Home page, Profile,Tips for Pet care, Nearest pet stores and 3 submenu depending of the type of the post (posts for lost,Found, injured pets).
